# Mall Customer Segmentation

This project performs customer segmentation for a mall using various clustering techniques, including K-Means, Hierarchical, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Spectral Clustering. It uses Python with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.

## Introduction

Customer segmentation is essential for marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences. In this project, I explore different clustering algorithms to group mall customers based on their annual income and spending score.

## Clustering Algorithms

The project includes Python code for the following clustering methods:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Identifies clusters and visualizes them using the Elbow Method.

- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Groups customers using an agglomerative approach and identifies cluster centers.

- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Fits Gaussian distributions to the data and identifies cluster centers.

- **Spectral Clustering**: Performs clustering based on nearest neighbors affinity and identifies cluster centers.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform customer segmentation using different clustering techniques.

## Results

- The project visualizes the clustered customers, identifies cluster centers, and provides insights into customer groups based on annual income and spending scores.
